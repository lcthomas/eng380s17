Each member of the class will have one day in which they are expected to inaugurate our discussion by articulating a brief (but detailed) **five-minute response** to the day’s reading. The requirements for this are necessarily very loose, as each day of the course will have a very different type of text to be discussed; in general, however, the discussion inaugurator will be asked to (1) articulate a thoughtful and critical response to some aspect of the material and (2) direct our collective attention to one or two problems in, questions about, or particularly important moments from the reading for that day.

Depending on the number of people enrolled in the course, we may need to double up on discussion inaugurators on some days. On those days, students may choose to inaugurate discussion together, or they may choose to do it separately. Students who are signed up for a day with two discussion inaugurators should speak to me about their plans after they have decided how they want to organize their discussion leading. A signup sheet for this role will be distributed in class after drop/add period ends and is linked to at the top of this page.

Discussion inauguration will be graded on an extra credit / pass / low pass / fail basis. For more details on this kind of grading, see the relevant section in the course syllabus/on the <a href="http://lindsaythomas.net/eng380/policies/" target="_blank">Policies</a> page of this site.
