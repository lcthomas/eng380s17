## Due

  * Monday, May 8 by 4:30 pm to Blackboard

For the final exam in this course, you will write 2 substantial essays responding to specific prompts (~5 pages each). It will be a take-home exam. The essay prompts will focus on putting the _secondary_ sources we read throughout the semester in dialogue with the _primary_ sources, and they will ask you to both reflect on what you’ve learned throughout the semester and to think about what this knowledge means and/or where it might take you. The exam will be worth 30% of your final grade in this course and it will be graded on an A-F scale. You will receive more information about the final exam as well as the prompts themselves as the end of the semester approaches.
